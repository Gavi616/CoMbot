# Blades in the Dicebot
A Discord bot custom made for Blades in the Dark.

If you've found any issues or improvements it could use, file a bug!

## How to install

Just follow this link:
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=689624467680395296&scope=bot&permissions=0

The link will prompt you to authorize the bot on a server. Once the bot's authorized, you'll see it in the Member List. In a public channel just type any of the commands outlined below and the bot will answer with a dice roll.

## Using it

`!`  Use ! to get its attention.

`! 2` The first number will make it roll that amount of d6s.

`! 2 r` Including the letter 'r' will make it perform a resistance roll.

`! r 2  / comment` Anything after the slash will be included as a comment.

`! resist 2d6` Works as you'd expect. The only things the bot looks for is the letter 'r' (not case-sensitive) and the first integer (2) outside of a comment.

`/help` Makes the bot repeat this set of instructions in the discord.
